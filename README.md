C preprocessor

Implements the [C preprocessor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_preprocessor) in C#.

Packaged as an [assembly](CPreProcessor/README.md), a [dotnet tool](cpp/README.md) and a [PowerShell cmdlet](cpp/README.md).

The intent is to allow you to preprocess data and configuration files using existing conventions. This allows you to add comments and conditional sections to your source files, these can be processed before the files are used in later stages.
